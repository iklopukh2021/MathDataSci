GitHub Markdown, also known as "GitHub Flavored Markdown" (GFM), is a lightweight markup language used to format text on GitHub and other platforms that support Markdown. It allows you to style your text and documents using a simple and human-readable syntax. Here are some of the most commonly used Markdown features on GitHub:

### 1. Headers

You can create headers using `#` symbols. The number of `#` symbols determines the header level (1 being the highest, 6 being the lowest):

```markdown
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
```

### 2. Emphasis

You can emphasize text using asterisks `*` or underscores `_`:

```markdown
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** or __bold__
```

### 3. Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists:

Unordered list:
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
```

Ordered list:
```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
```

### 4. Links

You can create links using square brackets `[ ]` for the link text and parentheses `( )` for the URL:

```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com/)
```

### 5. Images

Images can be displayed similarly to links, but with an exclamation mark `!` in front:

```markdown
![Image Alt Text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

### 6. Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes using the `>` symbol:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

### 7. Code

Inline code can be wrapped in backticks `:

```markdown
Use the `print()` function to display output.
```

For code blocks, you can use triple backticks for fenced code blocks:

<pre>
```python
def my_function():
    return "Hello, world!"
```
</pre>

### 8. Horizontal Rules

You can create horizontal rules using three or more dashes `---`, asterisks `***`, or underscores `___`:

```markdown
---
```

### 9. Tables

Tables can be created using pipe `|` characters to separate columns and hyphens `-` to create headers:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
```

### 10. Task Lists

You can create task lists for checkable to-do items using `[ ]` for incomplete tasks and `[x]` for completed tasks:

```markdown
- [x] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
```

### 11. Mentioning Users and Issues

You can mention GitHub users or reference issues or pull requests by typing `@username`, `#issue_number`, or `#pull_request_number`.

### 12. Emoji

You can add emoji to your text using `:emoji_name:`. For example, `:smile:` will display ðŸ˜„.

This is just a basic overview of GitHub Markdown. GitHub provides additional features and extensions beyond standard Markdown to enhance documentation and collaboration. You can find more information in GitHub's Markdown guide: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Practice using GitHub Markdown by creating README files for your GitHub repositories and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub.
