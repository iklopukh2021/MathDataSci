To create a random grayscale image and display it using Matplotlib, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries: You'll need NumPy for creating the random image and Matplotlib for displaying it.

2. Generate a random grayscale image: You can create a random NumPy array representing the image. Each element in the array corresponds to a pixel's grayscale value, typically ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

3. Use Matplotlib to display the image.

Here's a step-by-step implementation:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the dimensions of the image (e.g., 256x256)
width, height = 256, 256

# Generate a random grayscale image (values between 0 and 255)
random_image = np.random.randint(0, 256, (height, width), dtype=np.uint8)

# Display the random image using Matplotlib
plt.imshow(random_image, cmap='gray')  # 'gray' colormap for grayscale
plt.title('Random Grayscale Image')
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis labels and ticks
plt.show()
```

In this code:

- We use NumPy to generate a random grayscale image with dimensions `width` and `height`. The `np.random.randint` function is used to create random integer values between 0 and 255 (inclusive) for each pixel.

- We use Matplotlib to display the image with the `imshow` function. By specifying `cmap='gray'`, we ensure that the colormap used for displaying the image is grayscale.

- We add a title to the plot and turn off axis labels and ticks using `plt.title` and `plt.axis('off')`, respectively.

Running this code will create a random grayscale image and display it using Matplotlib. Each time you run the code, you'll get a different random image due to the random number generation.
